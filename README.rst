Can you predict the champion of the F1 Season?
Want to challenge your friends with your predictions?

Make predictions for the driver and constructor in every race of the season.

Rules
-----

* You may change the top driver and constructor upto 3 times in the season.
* If you change your top driver and/or constructor, the score from your prediction
  will be updated only from the next race i.e your scores will not be updated
  retrospectively.
* The user who correctly selects the driver and constructor with maximum points
  in a race wins the prediction. In the event of a tie, a user will be
  picked randomly and declared the winner.
* The results for a race will be declared after the publication of the official
  timing sheet by FIA.
* The user who scores the highest number of points from his top driver and
  constructor will win the season. In the event of a tie, the user with least
  number of prediction changes wins. If there is a tie based on this
  condition too, a user will be selected randomly and declared a winner.
* The results for the top driver and constructor will be declared after the
  culmination of the F1 season.
